# PyFTP
Basic &amp; sloppy programmed Python FTP client to do the most basic FTP stuff like downloading and uploading file(s).

Native FTP client encounters often problems, for example when trying to list files from the current directory. Such as getting stuck at this message:
- `150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.`
